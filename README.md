# IPW-g-comp-sim

Code is a work in progress and is currently written to run on the Emory computing cluster. More general code will be provided closer to completion.

There are 4 programs:
  - timefix_1-conf.R -- Runs simulation analyses for the **time-fixed** case with **1 baseline confounder**
  - timefix_3-conf.R -- Runs simulation analyses for the **time-fixed** case with **3 baseline confounders**
  - timevar_1-conf.R -- Runs simulation analyses for the **time-varying** case with **1 time-varying confounder**
  - timevar_3-conf.R -- Runs simulation analyses for the **time-varying** case with **3 time-varying confounders**
